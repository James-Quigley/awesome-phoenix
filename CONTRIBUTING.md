# How to contribute

Add whatever it is that you would like to the README.md. You can fork the repo and edit locally, or simply use Github's built-in editor. 

Try to follow existing formatting. In a lot of cases, it makes sense to alphabetize the items. If a list is already in alphabetical order, please add new items in alphabetical order as well.
