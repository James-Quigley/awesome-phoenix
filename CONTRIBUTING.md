# How to contribute

This list was designed for the development industry of Phoenix. Its primary goal is to help with jobs, furthering education, and betterment of the community and local industry. Add whatever it is that you would like to the README.md. You can fork the repo and edit locally, or simply use Github's built-in editor. 

In a lot of cases, it makes sense to alphabetize the items. If a list is already in alphabetical order, please add new items in alphabetical order as well. Generally speaking, try to follow any existing formatting.
